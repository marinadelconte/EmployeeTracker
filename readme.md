# Employee Tracker

## Description
The Employee Tracker database uses inquirer and SQL to display company information including an employee's name, id, job title, department, manager id, and salary. 

## Installation
To use this application first run "npm i" in integrated terminal. Next to begin running the program and to prompt the user questions, type "node index.mjs" into the terminal. This will run the user through a series of questions and answers depending on what they would like to view and/or add/change.
